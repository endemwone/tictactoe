A rusty implementation of Tic Tac Toe.

# Usage

Enter the required player against the player option.

`-x` or `--player_x` for player X.

`-o` or `--player_o` for player O.

You should specify both players.

## Players

`human` => Human player

`easy` => Level 1: AI that makes random moves

`medium` => Level 2: AI that finds the available winning moves

`hard` => Level 3: AI that finds the available winning and losing moves

`unbeatable` => Level 4: AI that makes perfect moves (TODO)


Have fun playing against each other or pit the AIs against each other
and watch the results.

### TODO

* Networking implementation (Playing with each other through TCP)
