A rusty implementation of Tic Tac Toe.

# Usage

Enter the required player against the player option.

`-x` or `--player_x` for player X.

`-o` or `--player_o` for player O.

You should specify both players.

You could specify a number for `-n` and watch the program repeat the game
for that number of times. There is a nice output which shows the number of
wins by each player and shows the percentage of wins by each player and
the draws. Pit different AIs against each other and watch those statistics
change.

## Players

`human` => Human player

`easy` => Level 1: AI that makes random moves

`medium` => Level 2: AI that finds the available winning moves

`hard` => Level 3: AI that finds the available winning and losing moves

`unbeatable` => Level 4: AI that makes perfect moves (TODO)


Have fun playing against each other or pit the AIs against each other
and watch the results.

### TODO

* Networking implementation (Playing with each other through TCP)
